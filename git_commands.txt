git init

git push --set-upstream origin master

git remote add origin https://github.com/ditml/github-tips.git



The default branch has been renamed!
master is now named main

If you have a local clone, you can update it by running the following commands.

git branch -m master main
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/main main
git remote set-head origin -a
